FBLA Navigator is a mobile application for Android devices. To login into the app, users must first fill out a form to join FBLA. Once in the app, users can view current events, competitive events, community service opportunities and fundraisers in the calendar or on the event pages. From both locations there are also options to sign up for all events, including meetings. On the about FBLA page there are links to state and national websites as well as a Q and A section. To connect with their chapter, users have access to links to social media, as well as a place to email there director directly from the application. A list of local, state, and national officer teams is also provided if the user wishes to contact them instead. Officers and directors may interact with the application by logging on to the website, [fblamanager.me](http://fblamanager.me/), where they can create and post new events and messages, as well as track users and meeting attendance. FBLA Navigator is currently error free, however a bug reporting system is implemented if the user later discovers an issue.
